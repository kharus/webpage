## eoshift

### **Name**

**eoshift**(3) - \[TRANSFORMATIONAL\] End-off shift of elements of an array

### **Synopsis**

```fortran
  result = eoshift( array, shift [,boundary] [,dim] )
```

```fortran
   type(TYPE(kind=KIND)) function eoshift(array,shift,boundary,dim)

    type(TYPE(kind=KIND)),intent(in) :: array(..)
    integer(kind=**),intent(in)      :: shift(..)
    type(TYPE(kind=KIND)),intent(in) :: boundary(..)
    integer(kind=**),intent(in)      :: dim
```

### **Characteristics**

- **array** an array of any type
- **shift** is an integer of any kind. It may be a scalar.
  If the rank of **array** is greater than one, and **dim** is
  specified it is the same shape as **array** reduced by removing
  dimension **dim**.
- **boundary** May be a scalar of the same type and kind as **array**.
  It must be a scalar when **array** has a rank of one. Otherwise, it
  may be an array of the same shape as **array** reduced by dimension
  **dim**. It may only be absent for certain types, as described below.
- **dim** is an integer of any kind. It defaults to one.
- the result has the same type, type parameters, and shape as **array**.
- a kind designated as \*\* may be any supported kind for the type

- The result is an array of same type, kind and rank as the **array**
  argument.

### **Description**

**eoshift**(3) performs an end-off shift on elements of **array**
along the dimension of **dim**.

Elements shifted out one end of each rank one section are dropped.

If **boundary** is present then the corresponding value from
**boundary** is copied back in the other end, else default values
are used.

### **Options**

- **array**
  : array of any type whose elements are to be shifted.
  If the rank of **array** is one, then all elements of **array** are
  shifted by **shift** places. If rank is greater than one, then all
  complete rank one sections of **array** along the given dimension
  are shifted.

- **shift**
  : the number of elements to shift. A negative value shifts to the
  right, a positive value to the left of the vector(s) being shifted.

- **boundary**
  : the value to use to fill in the elements vacated by the shift.
  If **boundary** is not present then the following are copied in
  depending on the type of **array**.

```text
    Array Type    | Boundary Value
    -----------------------------------------------------
    Numeric       | 0, 0.0, or (0.0, 0.0) of the type and kind of "array"
    Logical       | .false.
    Character(len)|  LEN blanks
```

These are the only types for which **boundary** may not be present.
For these types the kind is converted as neccessary to the kind of
**array**.

- **dim**
  : **dim** is in the range of

```fortran
    1 <= DIM <= n
```

where **"n"** is the rank of **array**. If **dim** is omitted it
is taken to be **1**.

### **Result**

Returns an array of the same characteristics as the input with the
specified number of elements dropped off along the specified direction
indicated, backfilling the vacated elements with a value indicated by
the **boundary** value.

### **Examples**

Sample program:

```fortran
program demo_eoshift
implicit none
integer, dimension(3,3) :: a
integer :: i

    a = reshape( [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 ], [ 3, 3 ])
    print '(3i3)', (a(i,:),i=1,3)

    print *

    ! shift it
    a = eoshift(a, SHIFT=[1, 2, 1], BOUNDARY=-5, DIM=2)
    print '(3i3)', (a(i,:),i=1,3)

end program demo_eoshift
```

Results:

```text
  >  1  4  7
  >  2  5  8
  >  3  6  9
  >
  >  4  7 -5
  >  8 -5 -5
  >  6  9 -5
```
