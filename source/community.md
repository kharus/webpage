Fortran Standard Library (stdlib)
:::

A community-driven project for a de facto 'standard' library for Fortran. The stdlib project is both a specification and a reference implementation, developed in cooperation with the Fortran Standards Committee.

History
:::

The effort to build a new community around Fortran started at the beginning of 2020
and was initially led by Ondřej Čertík [[1]][blog-ondrej] and Milan Curcic [[2]][blog-milan].
Starting in several discussions around ambitious proposals for the Fortran Standards
Committee, the Fortran Standard Library (`stdlib`) [[3]][issue-stdlib], the Fortran
Package Manager (`fpm`) [[4]][issue-fpm] and the [`fortran-lang.org`][webpage-orig]
webpage with new logo [[5]][issue-logo] were created.
With the new webpage and projects attracting more contributors, the Fortran-lang discourse
was created to provide a place for general discussions around all the things Fortran,
announcing newly started projects, getting help, etc.
Since its creation the Fortran-lang community was joined by hundreds of contributors.

Build and Test
:::

Get more involved with each project by cloning, building and testing
it on your own machine(s) and with your own codes;
if something doesn't work, create an issue to let us know!
We value user feedback highly, be it a bug report, feature request, or
suggestion for documentation.
